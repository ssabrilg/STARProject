## Abstract

This project explores the impact of class type and size on math performance among first-grade students participating in Project STAR. Using data from the STAR project, we investigate how variables such as class type, school, urbanicity, attendance, teachers' characteristics, among others, influence math scores. We begin with a descriptive analysis of the dataset, followed by a discussion of the experimental design's limitations. Next, we propose a fixed effects ANOVA model treating each class as an observation, with median math scores as the summary measure. Sensitivity analysis guides our approach, leading to the use of non-parametric methods to address non-normality in errors. Our findings highlight the significant roles of class size, school, and free lunch (as a sort of economical indicator) in shaping math outcomes, offering insights for educational policy and practice.
